# BIRDSEYE TODO LIST

Birdseye remains a pet project of mine and isn't on a path for real development.

Years may go by between updates, so this todo list helps me keep track of long term ideas.

## TESTING
-------

* Test on multiple *contemporary* Linux distributions and versions
* Test on very large hardware (difficult to access)
* Test on very small hardware (Raspberry Pi, etc)

## WISH LIST
-----------

* **Significant update for modern Linux OS diagnostics**. Birdseye's last major update was in 2015!  Linux's tools have changed significantly since then (More EFI platfroms, more cores per CPU, containers, etc)

* **Packages** in rpm and deb format for easy installation on Linux systems.

* **Documentation** that is comprehensive regarding the commands used.

* **Plugins** scripts that can be supplied by others to extend birdseye with custom inventory and reporting.

* **HTML/CSS Modernization**. A cleanup so the HTML output looks more modern. 

## KNOWN ISSUES
